🏗️ Modern Data Warehouse Implementation
This project demonstrates a comprehensive data warehousing and analytics solution built with SQL Server, following industry best practices in data engineering and analytics.

📖 Project Overview
Data Architecture
Our solution implements the Medallion Architecture with three distinct layers:
![data_architecture](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2161c628-fe12-4b06-a456-91ead92049ef)

1. Bronze Layer: Raw data ingestion from source systems (CSV files)

2. Silver Layer: Data cleansing, standardization, and normalization

3. Gold Layer: Business-ready star schema for analytics

Key Components
 ETL Pipelines: Robust data extraction, transformation and loading processes

 Dimensional Modeling: Optimized fact and dimension tables

 Analytics Layer: SQL-based reporting and dashboarding
